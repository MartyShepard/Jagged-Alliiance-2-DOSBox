How to:

1: Run the source installer on the cd and install the source to your favourite spot.
2: Copy the "ja2" and "Standard Gaming Platform" directories into c:\ 
3: Extract the included files into "Standard Gaming Platform"
4: Set up the include directories in VC6 to include the Build directory as well as subdirectories, also include the "Standard Gamin Platform" on the list
5: Include the "Standard Gamin Platform" path in the library paths
6: Go to Build->Set Active Configurations and chose Win32 ja2.exe release
7: Build the projects
8: Wait for 5 minutes, serve when ready

Please note that it's preferable to open the source by opening the workspace in the Build directory
